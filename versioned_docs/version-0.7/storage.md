# Storage

cnmsql gives every instance its own PersistentVolumeClaim. Because the operator
manages Pods and PVCs directly rather than through a StatefulSet (see
[Cluster Lifecycle](./cluster-lifecycle.md)), it can grow a volume and, when the
storage backend requires it, recycle the owning Pod to finish the expansion —
one instance at a time, primary last.

## Configuring storage

Storage is configured under `spec.storage`:

```yaml
apiVersion: mysql.cnmsql.co/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-sample
spec:
  instances: 3
  storage:
    size: 10Gi
    storageClass: fast-ssd      # optional; defaults to the cluster default class
  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      database: app
      owner: app
```

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `size` | Requested volume size. Required unless set in `pvcTemplate`. |
| `storageClass` | StorageClass for the PVCs. Applied after the template; defaults to the cluster default class. |
| `pvcTemplate` | A full `PersistentVolumeClaimSpec` for advanced cases (access modes, selectors, `volumeAttributesClassName`). |
| `resizeInUseVolumes` | Whether the backend can expand a mounted volume. Defaults to `true`. See [Resizing volumes](#resizing-volumes). |

The data volume name matches the instance: `<cluster>-1`, `<cluster>-2`, and so
on. PVCs are retained on scale-down — treat a retained PVC as database data, not
scratch space.

## Resizing volumes

To grow a cluster's storage, increase `spec.storage.size`:

```bash
kubectl patch cluster cluster-sample --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"storage":{"size":"20Gi"}}}'
```

The operator reapplies the new request to every instance PVC. Volumes can only
grow: Kubernetes rejects a smaller request, and the operator never shrinks a
PVC. The StorageClass must allow expansion (`allowVolumeExpansion: true`),
otherwise the API server rejects the change.

### Online expansion (default)

With `resizeInUseVolumes: true` (the default), the operator assumes the backend
can expand a volume while it is mounted. It patches the PVC request and relies on
the kubelet to grow the filesystem in place. **No Pod is restarted** — the extra
capacity becomes available to a running mysqld without downtime. Most modern CSI
drivers support this.

### Offline expansion

Some backends cannot expand a volume that is in use: the node-side filesystem
resize stays pending until the volume is detached and remounted. For these, set:

```yaml
spec:
  storage:
    resizeInUseVolumes: false
```

The operator then completes the resize by recycling each instance Pod after
patching its PVC request. The fresh mount lets the kubelet finish the filesystem
grow. Recycling is **serialised the same way as any rolling change**: replicas
are rolled one at a time, each rejoined and healthy before the next, and the
primary is rolled last (after a switchover when applicable), so the cluster keeps
a writable primary throughout. The operator records a `VolumeResize` event on
each Pod it recreates.

This setting also covers the case where a resize is requested while an instance
has no running Pod (for example a fenced or stopped instance): the pending resize
finishes when the operator next creates the Pod and the volume is mounted.

## Observing a resize

PVCs whose expansion has not finished are listed in
`status.resizingPVC`:

```bash
kubectl get cluster cluster-sample -o jsonpath='{.status.resizingPVC}'
```

For an online expansion a name appears only briefly. For an offline expansion a
name lingers until the operator recycles the owning Pod and the new mount
completes the resize. An empty list means no resize is in flight.

## Monitoring storage usage

Each instance reports the space used on its data volume, and the operator turns
that into both a condition and an event so a volume filling up is visible before
mysqld goes read-only.

### The `StoragePressure` condition

The operator raises a `StoragePressure` condition on the Cluster when any
instance's data volume reaches **85% used**:

```bash
kubectl get cluster cluster-sample \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="StoragePressure")]}'
```

`status: "True"` (reason `AboveThreshold`) means at least one volume is at or
above the threshold; the message names the affected instances. `status: "False"`
(reason `BelowThreshold`) means every reported volume is below it. The condition
only appears once at least one instance has reported its usage.

The condition message lists instance names but not live percentages on purpose:
usage changes on every write, so folding the figure into the condition would
rewrite the Cluster status on every reconcile. The exact figure lives in the
metrics below. On the threshold crossing the operator records a `StoragePressure`
warning event, and a `StoragePressureResolved` event when usage drops back.

### Metrics

Every instance exposes its data-volume usage as Prometheus gauges on its metrics
endpoint, independent of mysqld (they keep reporting even while the server is
down):

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `mysql_instance_data_volume_used_bytes` | Bytes used on the data volume. |
| `mysql_instance_data_volume_capacity_bytes` | Total size of the data volume. |
| `mysql_instance_data_volume_available_bytes` | Bytes available to mysqld (excludes root-reserved blocks). |
| `mysql_instance_data_volume_scrape_error` | `1` if the usage read failed, else `0`. |

A usage ratio alert is `used_bytes / capacity_bytes`; pair it with
[online expansion](#online-expansion-default) to grow a volume before it fills.
